Update the balance fetching logic so that: (1) balance fetching is skipped with a clear, user-facing error message when the wallet is not on BSC (chainId != 56), (2) refresh/polling cannot leave `isRefreshing` true indefinitely, and (3) any stalled RPC fetches time out and resolve into an error state instead of spinning forever.",
