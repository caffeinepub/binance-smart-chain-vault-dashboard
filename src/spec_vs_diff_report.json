  "summary": "Diff implements cross-tab vault balance fetching by lifting `useVaultBalances()` to `Dashboard` and passing shared state into `DepositForm`, `WithdrawForm`, and `BalanceView`. It also updates the token selector popover styling to be opaque and layered, and updates wallet-connect UX copy to be more injected-wallet/EVM-wallet agnostic with mobile guidance for in-wallet browsers.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added a reusable TokenSelectorInput with manual-entry vs saved-token toggle behavior (beyond just fixing dropdown opacity/overlap).",
      "reason": "REQ-22 only requests styling fixes to prevent dropdown overlap/bleed-through; the diff adds additional interaction modes and UI behavior not explicitly requested.",
