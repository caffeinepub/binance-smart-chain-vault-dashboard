      "requirement": "Remove the ZIP build export feature from the UI by deleting the \"Build Export\" section in the Diagnostics bar, including the download button, progress text, and the deployment instructions that reference downloading/extracting a ZIP.",
      "reason": "DiagnosticsBar.tsx is truncated and the diff summary does not show removal of a \"Build Export\" section or elimination of ZIP-related UI text; cannot confirm the card/section and related copy were removed.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Remove the underlying ZIP export implementation so the frontend no longer generates or downloads ZIP files, including removing the usage of exportFrontendBuild/downloadBlob and any ZIP writer logic that is only used for this export.",
      "reason": "buildExport.ts and zipWriter.ts are listed as modified, but their content is not shown. The DiagnosticsBar snippet also does not show whether ZIP-export-related imports/references were removed. Therefore cannot verify that ZIP Blob generation paths and related imports are fully removed or unused imports are resolved.",
