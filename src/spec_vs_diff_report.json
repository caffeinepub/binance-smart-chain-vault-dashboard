  "summary": "REQ-2 appears partially implemented via a new performanceCheck utility and new copy-to-clipboard logic in DiagnosticsBar, but the diff excerpt does not show the required in-UI “Performance check” section text/fields. REQ-1 adds /health.html, but the provided truncation does not show it displaying the build identifier from build metadata. REQ-3 shows boot-fallback styling and a build-id meta tag, but the diff excerpt does not show the boot fallback messages for the three failure modes nor confirms the build identifier is rendered in all non-success states.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Health check page (/health.html) must display the current build identifier from existing build ID metadata, in plain English, and load without React/JS boot.",
      "reason": "A static asset was added at frontend/public/health.html, but the truncated content shown contains only HTML/CSS; there is no evidence in the excerpt that the build identifier is actually displayed on the page (or how it is sourced from build metadata) and no visible plain-English guidance text confirming the intent.",

        "frontend/public/health.html (truncated; no build-id visible in excerpt)"

      "requirement": "Add a user-accessible “Performance check” section in the existing in-app diagnostics UI showing build ID, timestamp, and time from navigation to the app-mounted event, with a one-click Copy action.",
      "reason": "The diff shows performance data collection/formatting and a copyPerformanceCheck handler, but the DiagnosticsBar UI portion that would render a clearly labeled “Performance check” section (and display build ID/timestamp/time-to-mounted) is truncated and not evidenced.",
      "evidence": [

      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Boot fallback screen text remains clear/consistent for the three existing failure modes (resource/script load failure, network/connection issue, runtime error) and includes the build identifier in all non-success states.",
      "reason": "frontend/index.html includes boot-fallback styling and a .boot-build-id style plus a build-id meta tag, but the excerpt does not show the actual boot fallback message logic/text for the three failure modes, nor explicit evidence that build ID is rendered in every non-success state (loading/timeout/resource/network/runtime).",
      "evidence": [
