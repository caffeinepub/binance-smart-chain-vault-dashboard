      "reason": "While an identifier constant is added (APP_BRANDING.identifier) and the footer uses hostname/identifier for a UTM parameter, the diff does not show changes to startup wiring, mount signaling (`app-mounted`), boot fallback hide logic, or any specific reverted startup-time identifier strings that could have caused loading failures.",
